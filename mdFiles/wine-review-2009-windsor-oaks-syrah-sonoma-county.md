Wine Review: 2009 Windsor Oaks Syrah, Sonoma County<br/>2013-11-12 22:07:10<br/>[![\"syrimage\"](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/syrimage.jpg\")](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/syrimage.jpg\") This complex wine from Windsor Oaks is a perfect example of stylistic balance between the two different examples of California syrah: Warm-climate syrah (jammy, sweet dark fruit) in one corner, and cool-climate syrah (red fruit and bacon/meaty notes) in the other corner. Since this vineyard literally straddles the viticultural boundary between the cooling influences of the Russian River and the warmer Chalk Hill region, it makes perfect sense for this gorgeous bottling to have the best of both worlds!
