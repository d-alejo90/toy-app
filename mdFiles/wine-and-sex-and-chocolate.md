A beautiful spring morning, a delicious cup of coffee, or just a great hair day are feel-good experiences that we treasure and look forward to. Combinations of these pleasures makes them even more worthwhile and desirable. But if you\'re craving an even better combined experience, go for the ultimate: wine, sex and chocolate. Got your attention? Thought so!</span>

 <span medium="" style="\"font-size:">**Trifecta of pleasure**</span> <span small="" style="\"font-size:">It\'s a fact that wine and sex are one of the ultimate pairings imaginable. Who doesn\'t love the way the wine warms your body, loosens you up and creates time-stopping relaxation? Not to mention the fact that red wine in particular is linked to a strong sex drive. So what could make this combination even more pleasurable in the sack? Well, chocolate of course!</span> <span medium="" style="\"font-size:">**Pairing wine, sex and chocolate**</span> <span small="" style="\"font-size:">There are no rules when it comes to pairing wine with chocolate and sex. You want to find the balance of flavors that works best for your taste and libido. It\'s easier than you think to combine the three as long as you don\'t choose cheap versions of each. (And yes, I do mean cheap sex.)</span> <span medium="" style="\"font-size:">**Choosing wine**</span> <span small="" style="\"font-size:">When it comes to choosing the wine for your sexy rendezvous, just about any decent wine at the correct temperature will do. Don\'t serve room-temp Sauvignon Blanc or warm champagne as these are not at all sexy! Think a lovely Zinfandel or a warm Pinot Noir. Mmmm....perfecto.</span> <span medium="" style="\"font-size:">**Chocolate choices**</span> <span small="" style="\"font-size:">You can\'t go wrong with dark chocolate and red wine. But just like wine, chocolate should be chosen carefully. In other words, don\'t pair a beautiful merlot with a Snickers Bar. The stronger the chocolate the better, so pay attention to the cacao percentage in the kind that you choose. My recommendation: [Scharffen Berger](\"http://www.scharffenberger.com\")
