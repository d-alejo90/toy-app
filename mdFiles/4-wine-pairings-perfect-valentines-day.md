But sweeping your sweetheart of his/her feet with a little international flavor doesn\'t have to require stepping on a plane, or even leaving your sofa! Try these wine pairings for a romantic Valentine\'s day with a little international flair that your lover will adore. **Argentinian Malbec** Full-bodied, acidic, and boasting high tannin (and alcohol) levels, Argentinian Malbec is a wine with plenty of South American attitude. While malbec grapes grown in France can be too boring for anything but blends, sun-soaked Argentina lends enough personality to carry this popular grape into a class of its own. With a spicy and smoky flavor profile and a rich purple hue, this sassy red has the cojones to pair well with red meat, wild game, and even the fiery flavors of Cajun cuisine, Thai spice or American barbecue. **French Pinot Noir** Lighter-bodied and fruit-forward, Pinot Noir is the elegant red wine that even white wine drinkers can love. The best Pinot Noirs in the world come from their original home in the Burgundy region of France, although wines from California and Oregon can definitely give the French a run for money! The light tannic structure and fruity flavor profile of Pinot Noir makes it an excellent match for salmon, roast chicken or pasta dishes, for an elegant pairing that will show off your classy side. **New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc** A wine critic once compared drinking one\'s first New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to having sex for the first time. While Valentine\'s day is a terrible time to lose one\'s virginity, exceptions can and should be made for what some people consider the best Sauvignon Blanc in the world. This light and crisp white offers easily identifiable and explosive flavors. With a bright citrus taste and an aroma reminiscent of freshly cut grass, this zesty wine brings a little summer in a glass to the gloomiest of Februaries, and makes a perfect choice for an aperitif. **Spanish Rosado** Forget what you learned in Wine Snobbery 101; there is no shame in drinking pink wine. Dry and flavorful rose wine is making a comeback, thanks to its versatility and refreshing bright flavor. Spanish Rosado strikes a happy and food friendly medium between dry and fruity, with a feisty flavor profile that calls up strawberries and cranberries without being too sweet. The vivid pink hue of Rosado makes it a perfect choice for Valentine\'s day. Pair this hot pink mess with seafood, sausage, or sizzling...conversation. Â
