More importantly, when *combined well*, it can knock your taste buds outta the park. When it comes to pairing wine with food, an average Joe might only think of cheese with crackers or pasta...but there is so much more available! Each wine has its own distinctive property that affects certain foods, and you can find countless infographics and pairing guides laying out the almost endless possibilities. After trying a ton of delicious (and not so delicious!) pairings, I want to share with you my 3 favorite wine and food pairings. ***Schezuan Shrimp and Moscato d\'Asti*** One of my favorite pairings is Schezuan Shrimp and Moscato d\'Asti. Schezuan shrimp is well known for its intense level of spiciness, which is due to the exotic Asian herbs and spices used in its preparation. One easy rule for pairing spicy foods with wine is that you \'beat the heat with sweet,\' so this Asian dish is perfect with a semi-sweet, lightly sparkled wine.
