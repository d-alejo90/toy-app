Mile High Wines<br/>2013-06-08 22:50:58<br/>*![\"mile_high_wines\"](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mile_high_wines.png\")* Â  OK, before you decide to go to the next post on the site, let\'s have some fun. Wine selection can be a very picky thing, especially for a self-admitted wine snob like myself. So, how do you know that you are getting the best drink bang for your buck, especially at 30,000 feet above the earth? I have flown many times over the years, and I have to say that wine-drinking in the friendly skies has really grown. Many airlines now go out of their way to provide the best and latest selection in wines, including popular reds and whites. This is a big difference from other earlier years of flying, where the wine selection was choosing between Coke and Pepsi - always a bland red or white wine, and never enough on board when you need a glass. Now, this has changed and not changed, and here is a sampling of three airlines to give you an idea: <span style="\"text-decoration:" underline="">AMERICAN AIRLINES</span> According to American Airlines\' website (http://www.aa.com), you can get wines from a virtual United Nations of countries, including, but not excluded to, Argentina, Brazil, France, Australia, and other countries. However, there is only one champagne featured as a French selection, and it is Brut, not Extra Dry. Lots of reds and whites, but not enough champagne. There goes getting any newlywed flights... <span style="\"text-decoration:" underline="">SOUTHWEST AIRLINES</span> We all know Southwest Airlines as the so-called \"No frills\" airline - they get you there, at a low cost and with little amenities, so they say. The same goes for their wine selection. According to their featured in-flight menu (http://www.southwest.com), you have Coastal Ridge Chardonnay White and Coastal Ridge Merlot. Cue the Lewis Black joke about NyQuil - they come in two flavors, red and green, and they taste like red and green. Same goes here. Second, and most importantly, Merlot? My hatred for Merlot can be explained by the movie \"Sideways,\" where Paul Giamatti explains this clearly - enough said. <span style="\"text-decoration:" underline="">JETBLUE AIRLINES</span> Another popular, low-cost airline, but the wine selection is again \"Red and Green.\" You have Fuzion Chenin-Chardonnay and Fuzion Malbec - not a great selection. However, you can get Bacardi Rum, so harder liquors are OK. In short, choosing an airline for wine selection is, as Forrest Gump once said, \"like a box of chocolates - you never know what you\'re going to get.\"
