My Favorite Wine is Pinot Noir and Here is Why<br/>2013-09-12 21:42:51<br/>[![\"34\"](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/34.jpg\")](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/34.jpg\") <span large="" style="\"font-size:">**I Wanna Be Like Miles**</span> [caption id=\"attachment_255\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"180\"][![\"sideways\"](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sideways.jpg\")](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sideways.jpg\") \"Sideways\" movie poster[/caption] I love Pinot Noir because my main goal as a burgeoning wine drinker is to be just like the character Miles in the film Sideways. Although Miles is hot tempered, often belligerently intoxicated, mopey and a bit manic depressive, he is the wine enthusiast I aspire to become. Played by the great Paul Giamatti, Miles has a career as a writer. His newest novel is ultimately failing but, at the very least, was *almost* published. This means he can still tell people he is a bonafide novelist, which especially works on women after they have had a couple glasses of Pinot Noir at a local bar. After watching the film the first ten or so times, I decided to start writing my own novel and only write while drinking some delicious Pinot. Lately, I have been writing at the rate of one bottle per double-spaced page. I have even sent some sample chapters to a few agents and publishing houses, but they have unfortunately told me to keep on working. But that\'s alright...it just makes me even more like Miles, right!? <span large="" style="\"font-size:">**Guzzle It Down**</span> [caption id=\"attachment_254\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"][![\"paulgiamatti\"](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/paulgiamatti-300x180.jpg\")](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/paulgiamatti.jpg\") Image from the film \"Sideways\"[/caption] At first I hated the flavor of Pinot Noir. But in my quest to capitalize off the popularity of the variety due to the film, I kept guzzling it down until I liked it! Admittedly, the hardest part was that the only wines I used to drink were Pinot Grigio, Muscato and Mimosas....which are quite different. Although Pinot isn\'t quite as manly as my old favorites, its flavor has definitely grown on me. <span large="" style="\"font-size:">**How To Be A Pinot Snob**</span> [caption id=\"attachment_256\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"][![\"milespinot\"](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/milespinot-300x200.jpg\")](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/milespinot.jpg\") Image from the film \"Sideways\"[/caption] It\'s very important to know what to say about wine when you go to a wine tasting, festival or party. The key for me is really to trash every wine I try that* isn\'t* Pinot Noir, even if I really like the flavor. If you use this trick, it clearly makes you seem important and knowledgeable in front of all your friends and strangers you will never see again. I suggest aiming for highly offensive phrases like \"this isn\'t even as good as the 2005 garbage water!\" People will then automatically assume that you really know what you\'re talking about, even if it\'s complete bullshit. (And rest assured buddy, I won\'t tell!). <span large="" style="\"font-size:">**Keep It Going**</span> The case for Pinot Noir is obvious. It will at least be cool for a few more years, and if there is ever a sequel to Sideways (um, I vote yes!) it is bound to pick up even more steam! <span large="" style="\"font-size:">**My Question to You**</span> Finally after all of this Pinot Noir talk, it reminds me that I really need to start stocking up on my own collection. I\'ve been drinking all of my good bottles lately! So, I need your advice, fellow Pinot lover: in your opinion, what are some of your personal favorites in the Pinot Noir world that I *need* to get my lips on?
