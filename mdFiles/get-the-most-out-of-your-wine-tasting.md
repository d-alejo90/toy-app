Get the Most Out of Your Wine Tasting<br/>2013-10-15 00:50:02<br/>[![\"\"](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-14-at-1.25.12-PM.png\")](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-14-at-1.25.12-PM.png\") When we were all in college, we\'d quickly gulp down some one buck chuck for the pure purpose of getting a good wine buzz. But gone are those days! Now that we\'re older and wiser (well, maybe only a little), we\'ve discovered the art of really enjoying every bit about this great beverage. So, whether you\'re out at a nice dinner or at a winery, here are some ways to really savor your whole wine experience. ***Tasting*** No matter where you\'re drinking, there are certain ways to get the most out of your wine. When tasting a new wine, you\'ll have a small one ounce pour in your glass. While holding the stem, swirl it around in the bowl of the glass - not just to see the oh so pretty colors, but to really let the wine open up and release all of its wonderful aromas. After swirling a few times, hold it up to your nose. Yes, get right up there! Now, take a deep long breath...Aaahhhh. Smell is directly related to taste, so savor these scents as they drift into your nostrils. Take a moment, then...taste! But don\'t swallow immediately. Let it sit in your mouth so you can really taste the different complexities in the wine. Before swallowing, swish it all around so different taste buds capture the unique flavors. This, to me, is the best part of the wine experience...don\'t ya think? Finally, when you taste a wine that really resonates with you, go ahead and order yourself a full glass! ***Out on the Town Tips*** When dining out, your waiter will be able to help you decide on a good wine to complement your meal. If you happen to know what variety of wine you\'d like (Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot, etc.), they can also suggest what foods will go nicely with it. For example, if it\'s the heavenly burrata cheese appetizer you\'re dying for (like me), then ask for a wine that works well with its outrageous creaminess. Or if you\'re a diehard Zinfandel fan, ask your server for the best entree to match their best Zin. So go ahead, don\'t be shy - ask them for their recommendation! If you\'re at a hot foodie spot or a upscale restaurant, I assure you that these guys will really know their wine and food. Now lastly, make sure you ask to taste the wine.
