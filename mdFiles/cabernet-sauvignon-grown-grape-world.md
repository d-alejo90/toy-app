Cabernet Sauvignon: The most grown grape in the world<br/>2014-01-17 16:59:50<br/> 

<div id="\"textpreview\"">Cabernet Sauvignon is a must try for any current or future wine enthusiast. It is a red wine with an exotic infusion of blackberry, black cherry, black currant, and chocolate. It\'s even so amazing that it has become the most grown grape in the world (see TIME article [here](\"http://business.time.com/2014/01/06/cabernet-and-merlot-rule-the-world/\")). Said to compliment steak, lamb, and red sauce pastas, it can also pair well with karaoke, good movies, great friends, date night, and even difficult relatives at holiday dinners.</div><div></div><div>[![\"wine-goes-well-with-difficult-relatives-232x300](\"http://www.undergroundcellar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wine-goes-well-with-difficult-relatives-232x300-1.png\")](\"http://www.undergroundcellar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wine-goes-well-with-difficult-relatives-232x300-1.png\")The velvet, medium to full bodied texture of Cabernet reminds us why wine is often referred to as the \"nectar of the gods.\" It is rich, goes down smooth, yet fruity, and is just perfect for a cozy night by the fireplace. It also contains hints of tobacco and warm spices and can sometimes carry a hint of leather. **Major Regions** Major regions for Cabernet Sauvignon include Italy, Chile, United States, South Africa, Argentina, France, and Australia. Some wine makers may blend Cabernet with other grapes for a better flavor, lending to the difference in taste amongst the regions. For example, in the US, it\'s legit to blend up to 25% of other grapes with Cabernet and still be labeled as \"Cabernet.\" **Cabernet Sauvignon on Underground Cellar** We often feature some fantastic Cabernet Sauvignon\'s on www.undergroundcellar.com, and these are definitely ones I suggest you try if you\'re a cab newbie. The [2011 Susan Balbo Signature Cabernet](\"https://www.undergroundcellar.com/home/offer_detail/marvelous-mendoza-reds\") in the current \"[South American Classics](\"https://www.undergroundcellar.com/home/offer_detail/marvelous-mendoza-reds\")\" offer is a home run with a 92 point rating from Steven Tanzer\'s International Wine Cellar and an awesome description like this: \"If Cabernet Sauvignon dreamed, this is what it would dream about!\". **Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese and Cabernet Sauvignon** For my foodie friends out there, here\'s a great and simple way to pair your Cabernet: - 2 filet Mignon steaks
- 1 tsp butter
- Dash of Salt
- Dash of pepper
- 1/2 chunk blue cheese
- Cabernet Sauvignon
 
 1. Salt and pepper both sides of each steak. Cut a short, deep slit into the side of each steak. Stuff each steak with 1/4 piece of blue cheese. 2. Melt butter in a saute pan. Pan sear steaks about 5 minutes on each side, or to your liking. Let rest about 5 minutes. 3. Serve with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Enjoy! </div><div></div><div>_____________________________________________________
