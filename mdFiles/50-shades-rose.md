They\'re not quite as light as many white varieties, and not bold enough like today\'s reds, so many wine snobs completely snuff the idea of sipping on some. But I say, screw it! There\'s nothing wrong with enjoying a glass of rosé simply because of the pretty pink color, or what it does to [Jess on New Girl](\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/400468591836613490/\") or that you can create some damn good spring/summer cocktails with it. No judgement here! ***The Beginning*** Did you know that early on, red wines were not very dark? They were essentially the equivalent of a rosé today. A red wine from today would have been called pretty bitter and unwelcome to the ancient Greeks and Romans. Clarets from Bordeaux during the Middle Ages were known as &#147;wine of one night&#148; because the juice was only in contact with the grape&#146;s skin for literally *one night*. The rosé known today began after World War II. Mateus and Lancers, produced by two different Portuguese families, were sweet and slightly sparkling and sold in both European and American markets. Record sales helped them rule the Portuguese market for the better part of the 20th century. But when rosé began moving to drier varieties, their popularity started to wane. ***The Good*** 1. Rosés are delicious with practically any food item. There are suitable matches for veggies, meat, and even chocolate so it&#146;s entirely possible to have an elegant dinner with a different rosé at every course. I personally recommend pairing a rosé with some tasty summer BBQ. 2. Cocktails&#151;rosé mixes well with fruity flavors and offers a great base for mixed drinks. 3. Rosé has potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties when consumed moderately. 4. A 5 ounce glass of rosé contains about 82 calories, meaning this summery wine is totally bikini friendly! 5. Rosé contains resveratrol, though obviously not in the higher quantities found in red wines. ***The Bad*** 1. The white zinfandel that rose to popularity in America in the 70s. Overly sweet, it is responsible for much of the negativity associated with rosé wines today. 2. Bad rosés, like the one mentioned above, are often polluted with the addition of extra alcohol and sulfites, which can both cause some pretty gnarly headaches! ***Refreshing Rosé Ruminations*** The term &#147;blush&#148; used to refer to the faint pink color of the wine; however, now it refers more often than not to a wine containing a residual sugar content of 2.5%. In Europe, they call nearly all pink wines rosé no matter what their sugar content is. European rosé is usually called &#147;Old World&#148; and is practically always of the more popular dry variety. Rosés produced in America are referred to as &#147;New World&#148; and are usually much sweeter. Rosés from Provence will feature one of six different colors: melon, peach, red currant, grapefruit, mango or mandarin. Rosés are meant to be consumed when they are new, i.e. fresh. They&#146;re only good for a couple of years so take advantage when the new ones hit the shelves! Santé!
