Rosé wine isn\'t just for rappers anymore/s2013-05-13 17:54:29/sWith summer here, and warmer days approaching, it\'s time to put down the big, heady Cabernets and pop the cork on some Ros	instead. Warm days invite us to enjoy the sun, pack a picnic, and sprawl out under a shaded tree to enjoy ourselves. Rose wines are lighter, and pair well with many kinds of food. They\'re made for drinking, not aging; you don\'t need to be a level I sommelier to appreciate one. They range in flavor from sweet to dry, and can be made using almost any grape, although they typically come from red wine grapes.

### A little bit of history onÂ RosÃ©

 There are three ways to make a rose wine: skin-contact,Â saignÃ©e, and by blending. Most of them are made by the skin-contact method, which brings with it deeper pink colors than theÂ saignÃ©e method. First, the grapes are pressed, and the resulting juices are left to sit in the \"must\" for up to three days at most - longer time with the skins also contributes to the color intensity of the final product. Unlike red wines, the must is then separated from the skins and fermentation takes place without any skin contact. The saignee method occurs when a winemaker takes some of the resulting must from their red wine press, and filters it out of the container before it goes into the longer fermentation process. This \"bleeding\" process is French by design, and is a fairly common method used to make Rose wines. Because they often use the left over juices, or are made from the secondary harvested grapes, rose wines are cheaper and easier to make than their big red counterparts even though they might come from the same grape. You won\'t find many blended roses out there. Combining white and red grapes isn\'t a common practice, and I think most winemakers would shudder at the thought. ### Rappers and the rise ofÂ RosÃ©

 The life of a Rose wine hasn\'t always been one of glitz and glamour. In fact, it was once cast into the same category as White Zin, lost in obscurity. There was a time when most restaurants, especially high-end ones, would never include a Rose wine on their menu. Opinions have changed over the past decade, and now you\'ll find Michelin star restaurants from LA and San Francisco to Boston selling the stuff. The Drinks Business referred to the [rise of Rose](\"http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2012/08/top-ten-trends-of-the-last-ten-years-3-the-rise-of-rose/\") as one of the three biggest trends in wine over the past decade. I think there are a few reasons that correlate with its coming up, including a wider appreciation for slightly sweeter wines, which is something that seems to be gaining favor across the country. > RosÃ© in my champagne glass and diamonds in my ring

 What do rappers like Drake, Rick Ross, and Wiz Kalifa have to do with wine? Just like Jay-Z and Biggie did with Cristal, so have these rappers elevated varietals like Moscato and Rose to new levels of appreciation. Whether it\'s just because the varietals sound cool, or because they really like the nuances that a Rose of Pinot Noir delivers is up for debate, but there\'s a sure correlation between the bump in sales for these wines from about 2005 onward. There also seems to have been a steadily growing appreciation for sweeter wines across the country, and even overseas in the U.K. where sales have similarly skyrocketed. Sweeter wines are more approachable and easier to drink, and in areas like the South, which had previously had little exposure to many wines, theÂ consumptionÂ has dramatically increased. Regardless of the culmination of events that helped propel Rose through the ranks to be recognized as a wine that brings substance and style with it, we can agree that there are some fantastic examples out there. ### 3 Killer Roses

1. <span style="\"line-height:">**Belle Glos 2012 Rose of Pinot** - This example, from the Wagner Family of wine (they own the Caymus and Mer Soleil brands) is a stunner and highly drinkable. It\'s dry, with the slightest sweetness to it. There\'s a lot of flavor here, which is a great thing because the lack of skin contact and fermentation can sometimes lead to a lackluster wine without a lot of body. At $17 this is a bargain of a wine...if you can find it. Their [website ](\"http://www.belleglos.com/welcome.html\")does not list it currently, although I can testify to its greatness from a recent trip to the Caymus tasting room where I sampled it.</span>
2. **Francis Ford Coppola Winery Sofia Rose**Â - This is an accessible offering that most liquor stores and wine shops carry. It\'s a widely distributed Rose, but still maintains a good deal of finesse. It\'s fruit-forward delivery brings lots of ripe strawberry, and ripe watermelon with a clean finish thanks to the bright acidity. At aroundÂ $16 it\'s also very affordable.
3. **Bello Family Vineyard Brigitte Rose** - If you want to step your game up, and feel like a true baller, try [this Rose wine](\"http://www.bellofamilyvineyards.com/2012-brigitte-rose\") from Bello Family Vineyards. Their Rose of Cabernet isÂ perfect for any spring or summer dishes, with its lighter body and delicate flavors. With a lighter body and more delicate flavors on the palate, it is the refreshing accompaniment to a variety of warm weather fare. At $24, it\'s a bit pricier than some of the others but it also offers up a bit more style and class.
