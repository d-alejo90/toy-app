The Sexiest Wine Bottle Labels<br/>2013-09-04 21:05:50<br/>[![\"31\"](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/31.jpg\")](\"http://blog.undergroundcellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/31.jpg\")

Wine labels used to be fairly predictable, and actually, pretty boring at times too. They depicted vineyard scenes from centuries past, complete with horses, carts and toiling peasantry. Snore! But today the market is more crowded than ever, and vintners have to be a bit more creative if they want to attract our attention. A great way to generate buzz about a new wine is to become the hot topic on Facebook and Twitter, and one of the best ways to do that is by being a little risqu	 It\'s a cliché that sex sells, but it sure is true.

**1993 Mouton Rothschild**

Rothschild had long been a champion of the toiling peasants when they set off a storm intensive tut-tutting with a controversial label of a reclining nude by the French painter Balthus. The tradition of having a label designed by a famous artist started in 1946, but most of the subjects were clothed. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) stepped in after the easily offended raised a ruckus. Rothschild, in a brilliant display of French indignation replaced the offending label with&#133;&#133;&#133;nothing.

**2006 Cycles Gladiator**

Not to be outdone by the federalistas, the state of Alabama went one step further. Instead of banning the label, they just went ahead and banned the wine altogether. The offending label was a copy of an old ad featuring a naked woman with a flying bicycle. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board weren&#146;t about to put up with some highfalutin 19th century French marketing, especially of the &#147;immodest or sensuous&#148; kind. The California winemaker was not exactly devastated by this turn of events. They only sold 500 cases annually in the state and turned &#147;Banned in Bama&#148; into a badge of honor. Website traffic increased tenfold and sales took off.

**2003 Alexander Valley Sin Zin**

Perhaps the California vintner was hoping to get in on some of this banning action that was so good for business when they designed the label for their zinfandel. It&#146;s basically a mash up of the banned Rothschild label from 1993 and a banned 1975 Kenwood. Unfortunately, Alexander Valley missed out by not having a controversial artist behind their label. Rothschild had Balthus, Kenwood had David Lance Goines and Alexander Valley had, well, nobody like that. The upshot was that not a brow was raised nor a strongly worded letter received.

**1999 Peter Lehmann Semillon**

The Australian winemaker obviously had a plan when they attracted the BATF&#146;s fury with their label in 1999. It featured a bare breasted woman sipping a glass of wine. Showing breasts in the United States is a risky proposition at the best of times, but breasts painted in the style of Picasso, that&#146;s the Rubicon. The resulting flap attracted the BATF and the label had to go. Rather than taking a Rothschildian stand in the name of art, Peter Lehmann just added a bra to the label. As is so often the case in the world of wine, there are artists and there are businessmen.
