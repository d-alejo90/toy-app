Cooking the Perfect White Wine Sauce/s2014-03-14 17:53:33/sWhoever came up with the idea of adding wine to recipes is, in my opinion, a genius! Wine already enhances a tasty meal, but when cooked in with the food it adds a truly luxurious flavor. Now, I\'ve tried everything from wine poached salmon, to escargot sauteed in wine, to coq au vin....but when it comes down to it, beurre blanc is my favorite food recipe including wine. Beurre blanc is a white wine and butter sauce often used on fish, poultry, ravioli and even as a dipping sauce. It translates from french to english as \"white butter,\" and yes there is an insane amount of that creamy deliciousness in this sauce!

I was getting a little bored with drizzling my ravioli with a little olive oil and parmesan cheese, and so I tracked down a more interesting alternative. I found out that beurre blanc adds a serious punch to any recipe! Without further ado, this is the beurre blanc recipe I like to use when cooking. It is variation on a recipe by Alton Brown: ***Ingredients*** 2 shallots, minced 1 clove of garlic, minced 1 teaspoon of fresh rosemary 8 ounces of white wine (I like a dry sauvignon blanc or pinot grigio) 1 Tablespoon of heavy cream 2 ounces of lemon juice 12 ounces of cold unslated butter, cubed Salt and white pepper, to taste ***Directions*** Combine the shallots, garlic, rosemary, white wine, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium-high heat and reduce to 2 tablespoons. Add the cream to the reduction. Once the liquid starts to bubble, reduce the heat to low. Add the butter, one cube at a time, whisking first on the heat and then off the heat. Continue whisking butter into the reduction until the mixture is fully emulsified and has reached a rich sauce consistency. Season with salt and white pepper. Feel free to pair your beurre blanc with the rest of your wine used in the sauce or another dry white wine with a good amount of acidity. I also suggest serving the beurre blanc sauce on grilled chicken breast or goat cheese ravioli (like in the picture above). Lastly, make sure you have plenty of bread to dip in the sauce. Trust me, you won\'t be able to help yourself!
