There is a plethora of wine blogs out there on the interwebs. With so many people spouting off their experiences and opinions, it can be difficult to follow them all, and separating the gems from all the crap becomes a priority. Here are five of my favorite wine blogs for your reading pleasure.

[WineAnorak.com](\"http://wineanorak.com/\")

This blog is run by UK writer Jamie Goode. If you\'re on this side of the pond you might not have heard his name, but he\'s a pretty important writer for some well-known English wine magazines. Articles on his blog include ones centered around wine travel, wine tasting and vintners. I also appreciate his personal look into the life of a person who deals with wine daily on a professional level.

[AliceFeiring.com](\"http://alicefeiring.com/\")

Alice Feiring is a travel and wine columnist working for Time Magazine. Her wine blog, *Veritas in Vino*, is always a fun read. She uses the blog to share her personal thoughts ...and she has many! They are always good for a chuckle or, at the very least, a smile. According to her mission statement, she is looking for wines that tell a good story, and this is clearly reflected in her very entertaining posts.

[Wine Camp](\"http://winecampblog.com/journal/\")

Craig Camp, the owner of this blog, was an Italian wine importer in his previous life. He decided to take the plunge and move from Italy to Oregon and went to work at Anne Amie Vineyards. Despite his current status as an Oregonite, he still has some of the best and most in-depth knowledge of Italian wines around. Additionally, he makes some great posts about what it\'s like to work for a winery. Craig also writes some excellent restaurant reviews which, as I love me some great food, speak to me as well.

[Wine Tasting, Vineyards, In France](\"http://wineterroirs.com/\")

I\'m a very visual person, which is one of the main reasons this blog appeals to me: there\'s a bunch of eye candy. The site owner, Bertrand Celce, is a French photographer and stocks his blog with some truly inspiring and beautiful pictures.
