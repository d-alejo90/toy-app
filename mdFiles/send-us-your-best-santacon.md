Send us Your Best SantaCon Photo for an Underground Cellar Gift Card/n2014-12-10 15:55:49/nAs someone who grew up near The Bay area, I\'m quite familiar with [SantaCon](\"https://twitter.com/sfsanta\"). In fact, it\'s probably one of my favorite events in San Francisco. For anyone who either doesn\'t live in SF, or has never heard of SantaCon, it\'s basically a gigantic pub crawl of people dressed in holiday attire. There are tons of Santas (obviously), but you\'ll also find attendees in reindeer and snowman costumes, etc. SantaCon SF begins at an as-of-yet unannounced location this coming Saturday (December 13th). Check the official [SantaCon SF Twitter page](\"https://twitter.com/sfsanta\") on Saturday morning to find out details, then head out to the meet up location. Santas will usually gather to take pictures and sip off their portable beverages for an hour or so, then the crowd splits up as the Santas take to the streets of the city. Most will head to bars in The Mission or North Beach, but you\'ll see people wondering all over the city in holiday costumes. Here\'s a picture of a friend and I at SantaCon SF back in 2013. The starting location that year was Union Square. ![\"\"](\"http://i.imgur.com/yeFCsHb.jpg\")<span style="\"font-size:" xx-small="">Image credit: [Mathew Guiver via Facebook](\"https://www.facebook.com/mathew.guiver/photos\")</span> RSVP to the [Facebook event page](\"https://www.facebook.com/events/361054407404337/\") and tell your friends. Don\'t live in The Bay? Check out this [unofficial listing of SantaCon](\"https://www.santacon.info/locations.html\") events to see if there are any gatherings in a city near you. And now, for the important part... **We\'re giving away a $250 gift card to the best SantaCon costume!** Send us a picture of you and your fellow Santas this weekend. Our team will pick a favorite, and send that Santa a virtual $250 Underground Cellar gift card.
